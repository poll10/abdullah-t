    <h1>C++ Programming Language </h1>

    <p>C++ is a powerful, high-performance programming language that is widely used for system/software development and game programming. It was created by <strong>Bjarne Stroustrup</strong> in the 1970s as an enhancement to the C programming language.</p>

    <h2>Key Features</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Object-Oriented:</strong> C++ supports object-oriented programming (OOP), which helps in organizing software design around objects, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.</li>
        <li><strong>Low-Level Memory Manipulation:</strong> C++ provides direct access to memory through pointers, allowing fine control over system resources, which is beneficial in systems programming.</li>
        <li><strong>Multi-Paradigm:</strong> It supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and generic programming, making it versatile.</li>
        <li><strong>High Performance:</strong> C++ is known for its speed, making it a preferred choice for performance-critical applications, such as game engines, operating systems, and high-frequency trading systems.</li>
        <li><strong>Standard Template Library (STL):</strong> STL provides a rich set of algorithms and data structures like vectors, stacks, queues, and maps, which helps in writing efficient and reusable code.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Key Concepts</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Classes and Objects:</strong> C++ allows you to create classes (blueprints) for objects, which helps in organizing and managing large codebases.</li>
        <li><strong>Memory Management:</strong> With manual memory management, C++ gives you the ability to allocate and free memory using <code>new</code> and <code>delete</code>, offering flexibility but requiring careful handling to avoid memory leaks.</li>
        <li><strong>Templates:</strong> C++ templates enable generic programming by allowing you to write functions and classes that work with any data type.</li>
        <li><strong>Exception Handling:</strong> C++ supports exception handling through <code>try</code>, <code>catch</code>, and <code>throw</code>, enabling robust error management.</li>
        <li><strong>Overloading and Operator Overloading:</strong> C++ allows method and operator overloading, giving flexibility in how functions and operators are used.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Common Uses</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>System Software:</strong> Operating systems, file systems, device drivers.</li>
        <li><strong>Game Development:</strong> Due to its high performance, C++ is commonly used in developing game engines and graphics applications.</li>
        <li><strong>Embedded Systems:</strong> Its ability to work close to hardware makes C++ suitable for embedded systems.</li>
        <li><strong>Real-Time Systems:</strong> Systems that require high-performance processing, such as telecommunications and industrial control systems.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Advantages</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Efficiency and Performance:</strong> Being a compiled language, C++ is highly efficient and performs well in resource-intensive applications.</li>
        <li><strong>Portability:</strong> C++ code can run on various platforms with minimal or no changes.</li>
        <li><strong>Large Ecosystem:</strong> A vast library of tools and frameworks is available to ease development.</li>
    </ul>
